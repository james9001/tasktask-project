# tasktask-project

## Instructions
- Clone this repository locally.
- If you are on macOS or Linux and have Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed, you should be able to just run `./setup.sh`. I'm assuming your installation isn't rootless, so you will need to enter your sudo password. If some part of the script fails, open it up and the comments will explain what it is doing, in case you need to do something manually.
